# House-price-prediction
it is a Advanced Problem of Regression which requires advanced techniques of feature engineering, feature selection and extraction, modelling, model evaluation, and Statistics.
# Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this  dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.Deployed using flask.
# 1. Data cleaning
   We need to preprocess the data to transform it to a useful one and also to reduce its size, so that it becomes easier to analyze.We Dealing with numerical feature,categorical features,discrete features
# 2. Exploratory Analysis
   In exploratory analysis we describe about each features in House and selling price,Year_sold and selling price similary we doing with discreate features,continuous features and categorical features
# 3.Feature selection
   In feature selection, we taking importants feature to make the model perform well

# 4.Modeling
We will build two models (Random Forest Regression and Xg Boost)and evaluate their performances with MSE,MAE,RMSE,R- SQUARE metric Additionally, we will gain insights on the features that are strong predictors of house prices.
# 5.Deployment
 This model deployed using flask client interface
# Conclusion
Random Forest is the most accurate model for predicting the house price. It scored an estimated accuracy of 87%, out performing the xgboost by about 2%. Random Forest determined the overall quality of a home is by far the most important predictor. Following are the size of above grade (ground) living area and the size of total basement square footage. Surprisingly, the lot area did not rank as high as I had expected.
